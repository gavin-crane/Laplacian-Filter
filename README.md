This project was a paired programming assignment. I worked on this project with David Lee: https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-lee-290aa5188/

The repo contains an activity journal detailing goals before we started this project and what we learned after. There is also a report that explains
The program in more detail along with our thread efficiency findings.
